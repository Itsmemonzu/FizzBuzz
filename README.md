# FizzBuzz
A simple yet tricky problem which is even asked in interviews. 

Inspiration taken from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPZ0pIK_wsc).

# How does it work?
- Make the algorithm count from 1 to 100.
- For multiples of 3, make it say "Fizz" instead of the number.
- For multiples of 5, make it say "Buzz" instead of the number.
- For multiples of 3 and 5 both, make it say "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
